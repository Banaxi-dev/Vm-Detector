# VM Checker

This tool is designed to help detect whether the system is running inside a virtual machine (VM) or on physical hardware. It performs a series of checks across different system areas, including BIOS information, MAC addresses, registry keys, processes, hardware details, and more.

## Features

- **BIOS Information Check**: Determines if the BIOS hints at a virtual machine environment.
- **MAC Address Check**: Checks multiple network interfaces for MAC addresses typically associated with virtual machines.
- **Registry Key Check**: Examines the system registry for keys related to VMware and VirtualBox tools.
- **User Directory Check**: Analyzes the user profile path for potential VM-related folders.
- **Process and Service Check**: Looks for processes and services commonly found in virtual machines.
- **CPU Information Check**: Assesses the CPU model and makes sure itâ€™s typical of a physical machine.
- **Disk Information Check**: Inspects the disk model to look for virtual disk signatures.
- **Mouse Movement Check**: Monitors mouse movement patterns to detect virtual environments.
- **GPU Check**: Tries to access GPU 3D performance data to detect virtualized GPUs.
- **RAM Size and CPU Core Count Check**: Verifies that system specs align with typical physical hardware configurations.
- **Host Name Check**: Assesses the system hostname for VM indicators.
- **Nested Virtualization Check**: Looks for signs that nested virtualization is enabled, suggesting a virtualized environment.
- **System Boot Time Check**: Verifies system uptime to detect rapid VM boot times.
- **Hardware Manufacturer Check**: Matches system manufacturer to common VM environments.
- **Network Adapter Check**: Scans for virtual network adapters, often present in VMs.
- **WMI Errors Check**: Looks for any issues with WMI that might indicate a VM environment.

## How to Use

1. Go on Releases
2. Download the Exe file.
3. Run the `VMChecker.exe` file.
5. Based on the results, the tool will inform you if a virtual machine is detected, and if so, provide insights into which components suggested this detection.

## Usage

1. Run the program and choose one of the following options:
    - **D**: Detect the current PC configuration.
    - **T**: Attempt to remove VM traces (use with caution).

2. The program will perform a series of checks and display the results in the console.

3. Review the results to determine if the system is running in a virtualized environment.
